# Forest Fire Susceptibility Modeling in North-East Germany

This repository contains the code used to model current and future forest fire susceptibility in north-east Germany under different Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs).

### About the Data
Due to restrictions on sharing the original datasets provided by the Lower Forestry Authority of Brandenburg, we have included a sample dataset (sample_data.csv). This dataset contains randomized coordinates in place of the actual forest fire locations used in the study.

### Code Usability with Sample Data
Using the sample dataset, the code can be executed up to the section: "Boxplots of Value Distribution of the Three Most Important Predictors."
However, the subsequent sections on "Model Prediction" and "Model Validation" are included for illustration purposes only and will require additional datasets to run.

### Requirements
R.Studio version 2024.9.1.394
R version 4.4.1 (2024-06-14 ucrt) "Race for your Life"

### Additional information
This code is related to the preprint "Modelling Current and Future Forest Fire Susceptibility in north-east Germany" that can be found under https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1380.
